# sgronlu dotfiles

these are my dotfiles, simple enough.
## what i use
- dwm/i3
- zsh
- st (flexipatch)
- nvim
- dunst
- picom
- ~variety~ cronjob using feh
- nnn (file explorer)
    - thunar for more "advanced" operations
- lazygit (git TUI with basic keybinds)
- lazydocker (same as above but for docker)
- zoxide (cd but better)
- mise (tool for managing versions of node, python, golang etc.)
- uv (somewhat drop-in replace of pip written in rust)
