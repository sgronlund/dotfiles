# sgronlu dotfiles

these are my dotfiles, simple enough.
## what i use
- i3
- zsh
- alacritty
- polybar



## polybar scripts

- `spotify.sh`
  - Fetches Spotify metadata to show what's playing
  - Used to use [this](https://github.com/Jvanrhijn/polybar-spotify) but I enjoy shell scripts more so I wrote my own :)
